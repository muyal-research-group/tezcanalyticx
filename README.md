</div>



## Getting started üöÄ
### Prerequisites üìã
To run the basic first you need to install the following software tools:

-  Python >= 3.8  (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
-  Pip is intalled on your system when you install python
-  Install the dependencies (this repo has a ```requirements.txt``` file):
    ```bash
    pip3  install -r ./requirements.txt
    ```


### Introduction 
<!-- This is the analyzer server that receive from $n$ clients a batch of events of size $m$.  -->
The production and consumption pattern analyzer for serverless storage systrem is a sophisticated system software designed to predictive insights and actionable recommendations to improve storage utilziation, performance and availability.

</p>

### Deployment

First you need to run the server using the following comand, you must be in ```src/``` folder:
```sh
 uvicorn server:app --reload --port 45000
```

this command run a server on port ```45000```. ‚ö†Ô∏èYou can change the port but this implies a update in the logger handler.

### Testing

To send a workload events to the analyzer you need to run the following script located at  ```tests/``` at the same level there is a ```workload1.csv``` that contains a simple workload you can generate your own workloads or download a workload with 10k events [link](https://alpha.tamps.cinvestav.mx/v0/mictlanx/peer0/api/v4/buckets/mictlanx/72d28f66c6c0905b8e3fa78ee7adda796113d4df8c5dec5d1b67f3f585c7fc8d):
```bash
python ./basic_workload.py
```

## Popularity model

### Frecuency
$$feq_{i}(t)=\frac{\#access_{i}(t)}{\#total\_access(t)}$$
### Popularity
$$p_{i}(t+1)=p_{i}(t)+\theta\times feq_{i}(t)$$

$$p_{i}(\Delta) \geq p_{th}$$
